# Show-Install-Android-Iphone-App-Script
This is the script to show download app like Amazon , Flipkart does on mobile websites.

The script will detect Android and iPhone user on mobile, according to that it will show download information to the user.
iPhone user it will show iPhone app information and for Android user, it will show Android app information.
For test purpose I have used Whatsapp messenger link, under https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/#privacy-policy and which does not offend any privacy policy of WhatsApp, and if it does I happy to remove this same.
